Revision history for DBM::Deep.

0.97  ??? ?? ??:??:?? 2006 Pacific
    - Reorganization of distribution
    - Migration to Module::Build with EU::MM backwards compatibility
    - Test coverage improved to ??%

0.96  Oct 14 09:55:00 2005 Pacific
    - Fixed build (OS X hidden files killed it)
    - You can now pass in an optional filehandle to the constructor

0.95  Oct 12 13:58:00 2005 Pacific
    - Added optional autobless flag to preserve and restore blessed hashes
    - Fixed bug where 0 could not be fetched using get_next_key
    - Fixed bug where tie() constructor didn't accept a hash ref for args
    - optimize() now preserves user/group/permissions
    - Errors are now FATAL (meaning it calls die()), unless you set debug flag

0.94  Apr 13 19:00:26 2004 Pacific
    - Fixed bug reported by John Cardenas (corruption at key level when
         replace of less data was done on bucket)

0.93  Feb 15 19:53:17 2004 Pacific
    - Fixed optmize() on Win32 where orig file couldn't be overwritten unless
         filehandle was closed first.  This change introduces a potential race
         condition when using locking and optmize() on Win32, but it can be 
         fixed in the future using a soft copy instead of Perl's rename().

0.92  Feb 12 19:10:22 2004 Pacific
    - Fixed bug where passing a reference to a different DBM::Deep object
         would still result in an internal reference.
    - Added export() method for recursively extracting hashes/arrays into
         standard in-memory Perl structures.
    - Added import() method for recursively importing existing Perl hash/
         array structures
    - Fixed bug where optimize() wouldn't work if base level of DB was
         an array instead of a hash.

0.91  Feb 12 02:30:22 2004 Pacific
    - Fixed bug with splice() when length of removed section was 0
    - Updated POD re: circular refs and optimize()
    - Had to jump version numbers to 0.91 because in previous releases
         I used only a single digit after the decimal which was confusing
         the CPAN indexer.

0.10  Feb 11 08:58:35 2004 Pacific
    - Fixed bug where default file mode was CLEARING files (Thanks Rich!)
    - Added experimental support for circular references
    - Fixed bugs in shift(), unshift() and splice() where nested objects
      	in array would be recursively re-stored as basic hashes/arrays
    - Fixed typos in POD docs

0.9   Feb 10 03:25:48 2004 Pacific
    - Added Filters for storing/fetching keys/values
    - Added hook for supplying own hashing algorithm
    - FIxed some typos in POD docs, added new sections

0.8   Feb 8 02:38:22 2004 Pacific
    - Renamed to DBM::Deep for CPAN
    - Added optimize() method for rekindling unused space
    - Now returning hybrid tie()/OO object from new()
    - Basic error handling introduced
    - Added debug mode for printing errors to STDERR
    - Added TYPE_HASH and TYPE_ARRAY constants for "type" param
    - Added clone() method for safe copying of objects
    - Wrote POD documentation
    - Added set_pack() function for manipulating LONG_SIZE / LONG_PACK
    - Added aliases for most tied functions for public use
    - Now setting binmode() on FileHandle for Win32
    - Added 45 unit tests

0.7   Jan 4 11:31:50 2003 UTC
    - Renamed to DeepDB
    - Changed file signature to DPDB (not compatible with older versions)
    - Converted array length to packed long instead of sprintf()ed string

0.6   Dec 31 15:12:03 2002 UTC
    - Some misc optimizations for speed

0.5   Oct 18 08:55:29 2002 UTC
    - support for force_return_next parameter in traverse_index() method for 
      ultra-fast combined key search/removal

0.4   Oct 15 20:07:47 2002 UTC
    - now making sure filehandle is open for all DB calls

0.3   Oct 3 19:04:13 2002 UTC
    - fixed bug that could cause corrupted data when using locking

0.2   Aug 6 16:37:32 2002 UTC
    - Removed base index caching, as it can cause problems when two processes 
      are populating the db at the same time (even with locking)

0.1   Jun 3 08:06:26 2002 UTC
    - initial release
